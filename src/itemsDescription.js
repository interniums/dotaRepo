blademailText: 'A razor-sharp coat of mail, it is the choice of selfless martyrs in combat. Does not interrupts the caster`s channeling abilities upon cast. Upon cast, causes Blade Mail to reflect 105% of attack damage taken, plus the flat value. Also causes Blade Mail to react on other instances of damage besides attack damage, returning 85% of the damage taken. Returns the 3 damage types, but not self-inflicted damage and HP Removal effects (e.g. Sunder icon Sunder, Soul Ring icon Soul Ring etc.). Returns the same damage type as received. Only reacts on attack damage. Other sources of damage are ignored. Returns incoming damage before all manipulations. However, damage manipulation on the enemy still affects the damage normally. Reflected physical damage is affected by damage block as well. The returned damage is always dealt right after the incoming damage. Returned damage has the no-reflection flag, preventing its damage from interacting with other sources of damage with the same flag. Fully procs on-damage effects, except those which have a minimum damage threshold (e.g. Gravekeeper`s Cloak icon Gravekeeper`s Cloak). The damage has the no-spell-lifesteal flag, preventing its damage from utilising spell lifesteal. The damage has the no-spell-amplification flag, preventing its damage from being amplified with spell damage amplification. Returns damage back to the source. This means damage done by summons is reflected back to the summons, not to their owner. Damage Return has a global range and affects units through the Fog of War or invisibility. Does not work against wards, buildings and allied units.',

daedalusText: 'A weapon of incredible power that is difficult for even the strongest of warriors to control. Increases attack damage by an average of 37.5%.

In the original DotA, this item was called the "Buriza-Do Kyanon", a reference to a weapon (unique ballista) in Diablo II. "Buriza-do Kyanon" is the romaji transliteration of "Blizzard Cannon" when written in Japanese katakana.

midasText: 'Preserved through unknown magical means, the Hand of Midas is a weapon of greed, sacrificing animals to line the owner`s pockets. Hand of Midas icon Transmute fully replaces the targeted unit`s gold bounty, so that the target`s default gold bounty is not granted. The effective gold gained can be defined as: expr160 - UnitGoldBounty. Because of this discrepancy, if it is used on big units, you lose almost half the unit`s actual Gold Gold bounty but gain over double the ExperienceXP. Flagbearer Creeps still grant the aura bounty. For more information, see here. Transmute has 1 charge upon acquiring the item. Upon cast, Transmute instantly kills the target unit, dealing expr 100%. CurrentHP damage to kill the targeted creep, triggering most on-damage events (e.g. creep aggro). This damage fully ignores any form of damage manipulation. Grants the caster 160 Gold unreliable gold and expr 2.1. XPBounty. The target`s default bounties are not granted. This means that no hero nearby gains the default gold and experience from death.

Equipping the Boots of Travel icon Boots of Travel created by disassembling Boots of Travel 2 icon Boots of Travel 2 also does not repeat the effects. However, creating a new instance of the item (e.g. reassembling it after disassembling it, or upgrading from Boots of Travel icon Boots of Travel to Boots of Travel 2 icon Boots of Travel 2) does repeat the effects. If the entire stack of scrolls can be sold at full price, all scrolls that have value will be sold at full price.',
